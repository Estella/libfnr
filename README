    libFNR - A reference implementation library for FNR encryption scheme.

    FNR represents "Flexible Naor and Reingold" 

    FNR is a small domain block cipher to encrypt small domain
    objects ( < 128 bits ) like IPv4, MAC, Credit Card numbers etc.

    FNR is designed by Sashank Dara (sadara@cisco.com), Scott Fluhrer (sfluhrer@cisco.com)
